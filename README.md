# restaurant-page

Another Odin Project. Building a restaurant page using JS to populate all DOM elements.

Introducing importing/exporting of different scripts, along with functionality of webpack and npm.
Also used the new idea of classes for introducing all the menu items. Each menu item has a method which creates it's own Dom element easily.

Had an issue with gh pages not loading my images, when using webpack use the import feature for images. It fixed this issue.
